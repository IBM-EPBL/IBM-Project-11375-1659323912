<h2>Description</h2>
This is based on child safety a gadget is developed to monitor
the child’s location continuously. They can leave their children in
school or parks and create a geo-fence around the particular location.
The child&#39;s location notifications will be generated if the child crosses
the geo-fence. Notifications will be sent according to the child&#39;s
location to their parents or caretakers. The entire location data will be
stored in the database. Our projects help the parents to monitor their
children they can see their location and they will be updated by their
child’s location as a notification each and every time based on their
needs, parents also get notifications when their child leaves the geo-
fence created by them. The main safety feature is to alert parents
when their child crosses the geo-fence and when the temperature and
heart rate of the children will be updated to the parents.
